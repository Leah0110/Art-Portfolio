             Hello, you can call me Dark or Hearts. Like other artists I had drew ever since I was little, some may not e perfect but hey, thats how growing works. The way I started to draw was when my little brother, sadly, had cancer.
             So I would draw all kinds of character art (Stick firgures) for him to make him smile and enjoy what he was getting. (Hes cancer free now 6 years! WOO)
             And now I enjoy drawing. Ive self taught myself by watching a lot of youtubers and speedpaints so i can try to draw like them. I'm still learning more about drawing, including anatomy, poses, and finding my own style that I am comfortble with.
             Now since I've grown (still am) I've decided to move on to the next level...by offering commissions to others. So I hope you like what I have to offer.
         </h3>
